To commit in Git using Git Bash, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to your project folder** (if you aren't already there):

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/repository
   ```

2. **Check the status** of your repository:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   This will show you the changes that have been made.

3. **Add changes** to the staging area:

   * To add specific files:

     ```bash
     git add <file_name>
     ```
   * To add all changes (new, modified, and deleted files):

     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

4. **Commit the changes** with a message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

5. **Push the changes** to the remote repository (if necessary):

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```
